#!/usr/bin/env bash

# entry point is running:
# - pre-init scripts
# - executes dumb-init with rc.local
# - which in turn runs post-init at the very end

# ...and this very last job should never go to background:

/usr/bin/runsvdir -P /etc/service

# perhaps... there is a better way to exec it at end of rc.local? need test.
